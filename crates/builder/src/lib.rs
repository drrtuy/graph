//! A library that can be used as a building block for high-performant graph
//! algorithms.
//!
//! Graph provides implementations for directed and undirected graphs. Graphs
//! can be created programatically or read from custom input formats in a
//! type-safe way. The library uses [rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon)
//! to parallelize all steps during graph creation.
//!
//! The implementation uses a Compressed-Sparse-Row (CSR) data structure which
//! is tailored for fast and concurrent access to the graph topology.
//!
//! **Note**: The development is mainly driven by
//! [Neo4j](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j) developers. However, the library is
//! __not__ an official product of Neo4j.
//!
//! # What is a graph?
//!
//! A graph consists of nodes and edges where edges connect exactly two nodes. A
//! graph can be either directed, i.e., an edge has a source and a target node
//! or undirected where there is no such distinction.
//!
//! In a directed graph, each node `u` has outgoing and incoming neighbors. An
//! outgoing neighbor of node `u` is any node `v` for which an edge `(u, v)`
//! exists. An incoming neighbor of node `u` is any node `v` for which an edge
//! `(v, u)` exists.
//!
//! In an undirected graph there is no distinction between source and target
//! node. A neighbor of node `u` is any node `v` for which either an edge `(u,
//! v)` or `(v, u)` exists.
//!
//! # How to build a graph
//!
//! The library provides a builder that can be used to construct a graph from a
//! given list of edges.
//!
//! For example, to create a directed graph that uses `usize` as node
//! identifier, one can use the builder like so:
//!
//! ```
//! use graph_builder::prelude::*;
//!
//! let graph: DirectedCsrGraph<usize> = GraphBuilder::new()
//!     .edges(vec![(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)])
//!     .build();
//!
//! assert_eq!(graph.node_count(), 4);
//! assert_eq!(graph.edge_count(), 5);
//!
//! assert_eq!(graph.out_degree(1), 2);
//! assert_eq!(graph.in_degree(1), 1);
//!
//! assert_eq!(graph.out_neighbors(1).as_slice(), &[2, 3]);
//! assert_eq!(graph.in_neighbors(1).as_slice(), &[0]);
//! ```
//!
//! To build an undirected graph using `u32` as node identifer, we only need to
//! change the expected types:
//!
//! ```
//! use graph_builder::prelude::*;
//!
//! let graph: UndirectedCsrGraph<u32> = GraphBuilder::new()
//!     .csr_layout(CsrLayout::Sorted)
//!     .edges(vec![(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)])
//!     .build();
//!
//! assert_eq!(graph.node_count(), 4);
//! assert_eq!(graph.edge_count(), 5);
//!
//! assert_eq!(graph.degree(1), 3);
//!
//! assert_eq!(graph.neighbors(1).as_slice(), &[0, 2, 3]);
//! ```
//!
//! Edges can have attached values to represent weighted graphs:
//!
//! ```
//! use graph_builder::prelude::*;
//!
//! let graph: UndirectedCsrGraph<u32, (), f32> = GraphBuilder::new()
//!     .csr_layout(CsrLayout::Sorted)
//!     .edges_with_values(vec![(0, 1, 0.5), (0, 2, 0.7), (1, 2, 0.25), (1, 3, 1.0), (2, 3, 0.33)])
//!     .build();
//!
//! assert_eq!(graph.node_count(), 4);
//! assert_eq!(graph.edge_count(), 5);
//!
//! assert_eq!(graph.degree(1), 3);
//!
//! assert_eq!(
//!     graph.neighbors_with_values(1).as_slice(),
//!     &[Target::new(0, 0.5), Target::new(2, 0.25), Target::new(3, 1.0)]
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! It is also possible to create a graph from a specific input format. In the
//! following example we use the `EdgeListInput` which is an input format where
//! each line of a file contains an edge of the graph.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::path::PathBuf;
//!
//! use graph_builder::prelude::*;
//!
//! let path = [env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), "resources", "example.el"]
//!     .iter()
//!     .collect::<PathBuf>();
//!
//! let graph: DirectedCsrGraph<usize> = GraphBuilder::new()
//!     .csr_layout(CsrLayout::Sorted)
//!     .file_format(EdgeListInput::default())
//!     .path(path)
//!     .build()
//!     .expect("loading failed");
//!
//! assert_eq!(graph.node_count(), 4);
//! assert_eq!(graph.edge_count(), 5);
//!
//! assert_eq!(graph.out_degree(1), 2);
//! assert_eq!(graph.in_degree(1), 1);
//!
//! assert_eq!(graph.out_neighbors(1).as_slice(), &[2, 3]);
//! assert_eq!(graph.in_neighbors(1).as_slice(), &[0]);
//! ```
//!
//! The `EdgeListInput` format also supports weighted edges. This can be
//! controlled by a single type parameter on the graph type. Note, that the edge
//! value type needs to implement [`crate::input::ParseValue`].
//!
//! ```
//! use std::path::PathBuf;
//!
//! use graph_builder::prelude::*;
//!
//! let path = [env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), "resources", "example.wel"]
//!     .iter()
//!     .collect::<PathBuf>();
//!
//! let graph: DirectedCsrGraph<usize, (), f32> = GraphBuilder::new()
//!     .csr_layout(CsrLayout::Sorted)
//!     .file_format(EdgeListInput::default())
//!     .path(path)
//!     .build()
//!     .expect("loading failed");
//!
//! assert_eq!(graph.node_count(), 4);
//! assert_eq!(graph.edge_count(), 5);
//!
//! assert_eq!(graph.out_degree(1), 2);
//! assert_eq!(graph.in_degree(1), 1);
//!
//! assert_eq!(
//!     graph.out_neighbors_with_values(1).as_slice(),
//!     &[Target::new(2, 0.25), Target::new(3, 1.0)]
//! );
//! assert_eq!(
//!     graph.in_neighbors_with_values(1).as_slice(),
//!     &[Target::new(0, 0.5)]
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! # Types of graphs
//!
//! The crate currently ships with two graph implementations:
//!
//! ## Compressed Sparse Row (CSR)
//!
//! [CSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Compressed_sparse_row_(CSR,_CRS_or_Yale_format))
//! is a data structure used for representing a sparse matrix. Since graphs can be modelled as adjacency
//! matrix and are typically very sparse, i.e., not all possible pairs of nodes are connected
//! by an edge, the CSR representation is very well suited for representing a real-world graph topology.
//!
//! In our current implementation, we use two arrays two model the edges. One array stores the adjacency
//! lists for all nodes consecutively which requires `O(edge_count)` space. The other array stores the
//! offset for each node in the first array where the corresponding adjacency list can be found which
//! requires `O(node_count)` space. The degree of a node can be inferred from the offset array.
//!
//! Our CSR implementation is immutable, i.e., once built, the topology of the graph cannot be altered as
//! it would require inserting target ids and shifting all elements to the right which is expensive and
//! invalidates all offsets coming afterwards. However, building the CSR data structure from a list of
//! edges is implement very efficiently using multi-threading.
//!
//! However, due to inlining the all adjacency lists in one `Vec`, access becomes very cache-friendly,
//! as there is a chance that the adjacency list of the next node is already cached. Also, reading the
//! graph from multiple threads is safe, as there will be never be a concurrent mutable access.
//!
//! One can use [`DirectedCsrGraph`] or [`UndirectedCsrGraph`] to build a CSR-based graph:
//!
//! ```
//! use graph_builder::prelude::*;
//!
//! let graph: DirectedCsrGraph<usize> = GraphBuilder::new()
//!     .edges(vec![(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)])
//!     .build();
//!
//! assert_eq!(graph.node_count(), 4);
//! assert_eq!(graph.edge_count(), 5);
//!
//! assert_eq!(graph.out_degree(1), 2);
//! assert_eq!(graph.in_degree(1), 1);
//!
//! assert_eq!(graph.out_neighbors(1).as_slice(), &[2, 3]);
//! assert_eq!(graph.in_neighbors(1).as_slice(), &[0]);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Adjacency List (AL)
//!
//! In the Adjacency List implementation, we essentially store the graph as `Vec<Vec<ID>>`. The outer
//! `Vec` has a length of `node_count` and at each index, we store the neighbors for that particular
//! node in its own, heap-allocated `Vec`.
//!
//! The downside of that representation is that - compared to CSR - it is expected to be slower, both
//! in building it and also in reading from it, as cache misses are becoming more likely due to the
//! isolated heap allocations for individual neighbor lists.
//!
//! However, in contrast to CSR, an adjacency list is mutable, i.e., it is possible to add edges to the
//! graph even after it has been built. This makes the data structure interesting for more flexible graph
//! construction frameworks or for algorithms that need to add new edges as part of the computation.
//! Currently, adding edges is constrained by source and target node already existing in the graph.
//!
//! Internally, the individual neighbor lists for each node are protected by a `Mutex` in order to support
//! parallel read and write operations on the graph topology.
//!
//! One can use [`DirectedALGraph`] or [`UndirectedALGraph`] to build a Adjacency-List-based graph:
//!
//! ```
//! use graph_builder::prelude::*;
//!
//! let graph: DirectedALGraph<usize> = GraphBuilder::new()
//!     .edges(vec![(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)])
//!     .build();
//!
//! assert_eq!(graph.node_count(), 4);
//! assert_eq!(graph.edge_count(), 5);
//!
//! assert_eq!(graph.out_degree(1), 2);
//! assert_eq!(graph.in_degree(1), 1);
//!
//! assert_eq!(graph.out_neighbors(1).as_slice(), &[2, 3]);
//! assert_eq!(graph.in_neighbors(1).as_slice(), &[0]);
//!
//! // Let's mutate the graph by adding another edge
//! graph.add_edge(1, 0);
//! assert_eq!(graph.edge_count(), 6);
//! assert_eq!(graph.out_neighbors(1).as_slice(), &[2, 3, 0]);
//! ```
